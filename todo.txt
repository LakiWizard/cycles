To do:

basic game:
  - create classes for players and map
  - implement drawing the map and players
  - implement the basic loop, with input and output
  - do the trailing lines, collision detection
      (how to store and update the lines in an iterable manner)
      (how to efficiently check for collisions)
  - add the obstacles

extra:
  - add the top bar for counting the score
  - implement the shrinking playing field
  - add a nice main menu (?)
